random programming experimentations

various goals:
- learning a compiled language (rust)
- learning how make slow python run faster (pypy, cffi, cppyy, cython, numba)
  - python integrations with compiled languages (rust [pyoxygen], cpp [pybind11], nim [nimpy])
- get better at writing cpp (make skeleton project, cmake [https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/])
